**Overview:** 

This Excel-based data analysis project explores customer demographics and behaviors to understand factors influencing bike purchases. The dataset contains over 1,000 records including variables such as gender, income, marital status, commute distance, and education level.



**Steps Involved**

1\. Data Cleaning and Preparation

&nbsp;  - Converted coded values to readable labels  

&nbsp;  - Grouped age into brackets  

&nbsp;  - Standardized text formatting



2\. Descriptive Analysis 

&nbsp;  - Used pivot tables to study purchasing patterns by gender, age, commute distance, education, and income  

&nbsp;  - Compared average income of bike buyers and non-buyers



3\. Visual Insights 

&nbsp;  - Created dashboards showing:  

&nbsp;    - Purchase distribution by region and age  

&nbsp;    - Impact of income on buying behavior  

&nbsp;    - Relationship between commute distance and bike ownership



4\. Segmentation 

&nbsp;  - Analyzed demographic clusters including:  

&nbsp;    - High earners with long commutes  

&nbsp;    - Younger individuals with lower income  

&nbsp;    - Influence of car ownership and children



**Conclusion** 

\- Middle-aged people are most likely to buy bikes  

\- Income and commute distance are key factors  

\- Higher education and professional roles increase purchase likelihood  

\- Minor gender differences in purchasing trends



This project demonstrates how Excel can uncover meaningful insights from customer data, supporting better business decisions in retail and forecasting.
